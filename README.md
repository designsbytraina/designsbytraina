### Designs by Traina :heavy_multiplication_x: Redesign

##### [designsbytraina.com](http://designsbytraina.com/)

This repo contains the code for my portfolio app built with Python Flask and deployed to Heroku. Site was previously deployed using FTP and code is [archived here](https://github.com/designsbytraina/portfolio).

##### About Me
Inspired by my grandfather's moniker -- "Signs by Traina" -- I bring a creative eye to front- and back-end development. With an intuition to ask, "Why?" I push those around me to think outside the box and create thoughtful solutions for everyday problems.

###### Let's make something together :v:
